# Student Exam Performance Indicator

## Project Description

This project is a simple machine learning application that predicts a student's math score based on various input features. The core of the prediction model utilizes a **Linear Regressor**.

The application is built using Flask to provide a web interface for making predictions.

## Features (Inputs)

The model uses the following inputs to predict the math score:

* Gender
* Race/Ethnicity
* Parental Level of Education
* Lunch Type
* Test Preparation Course
* Reading Score
* Writing Score

## Target Variable (Output)

* Math Score (Predicted)

## Model Details

* **Model Used:** Linear Regressor
* **Performance:** The model achieved a performance metric (accuracy/R-squared) of **0.8804**. *(Note: For a regression model predicting a continuous score, this metric is  R-squared  regression score, . ).*

Okay, here is the English translation of your description:

"I have created a machine learning project which uses a linear regressor. This is a simple model where the math score is predicted after providing some inputs. The accuracy of the linear regressor is 0.8804332983749565. The inputs are gender, race/ethnicity, parental level of education, lunch, test preparation course, reading score, and writing score. Now I need to create a README file, so please create a README file."

# Student Exam Performance Indicator

## Project Description

This project is a simple machine learning application that predicts a student's math score based on various input features. The core of the prediction model utilizes a **Linear Regressor**.

The application is built using Flask to provide a web interface for making predictions.

## Features (Inputs)

The model uses the following inputs to predict the math score:

* Gender
* Race/Ethnicity
* Parental Level of Education
* Lunch Type
* Test Preparation Course
* Reading Score
* Writing Score

## Target Variable (Output)

* Math Score (Predicted)

## Model Details

* **Model Used:** Linear Regressor
* **Performance:** The model achieved a performance metric (accuracy/R-squared) of **0.8804**. *(Note: For a regression model predicting a continuous score, this metric is likely R-squared or a similar regression score, rather than classification accuracy. Adjust the term 'accuracy' if you know the specific metric used).*

## Setup and Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url> # Replace <repository_url> with your actual repository URL
    cd MLPROJECT
    ```
2.  **Create a virtual environment** (recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv mlp_env
    ```
3.  **Activate the virtual environment:**
    * On Windows:
        ```bash
        .\mlp_env\Scripts\activate
        ```
    * On macOS and Linux:
        ```bash
        source mlp_env/bin/activate
        ```
4.  **Install the required packages:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    You might also need to install the project itself if you have a `setup.py`:
    ```bash
    pip install -e .
    ```
5.  **Ensure Artifacts Exist:** Make sure you have run your data transformation and model training scripts (`src/components/data_transformation.py`, `src/components/model_trainer.py` or similar) at least once to generate the `preprocessor.pkl` and `model.pkl` files in the `artifacts` directory. These are necessary for the prediction pipeline.

## How to Run

1.  **Activate your virtual environment** (if not already active):
    * On Windows: `.\mlp_env\Scripts\activate`
    * On macOS and Linux: `source mlp_env/bin/activate`
2.  **Navigate to the project's root directory** (`MLPROJECT`):
    ```bash
    cd d:\New folder\mlproject # Or your project's root path
    ```
3.  **Run the Flask application:**
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
4.  Open your web browser and go to the address displayed in your terminal (usually `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`).

The web interface will allow you to input the student details and get the predicted math score.
